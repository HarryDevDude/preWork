	I'm going to write notes for things I've noticed while becoming a developer here. It's going to be a little messy but I think it is important for me to have notes about my process and hopefully progress on becoming a software developer.
<br>
<br>
	I'm making a separate html page to add code from the Pre Work slides to reference back.
<br>
<br>
	Josh mentioned that 'div' tags are considered "wildcards". Where you can add into a page for content that's whatever.
<br>
<br>
	Took a walk after lunch and realized that I should make HTML, CSS, and JavaScript their own separate pages and reference them with links to reference.
<br>
<br>
	While writing out notes here, it's getting annoying to have to us 'br' tag to separate each thought. NEED TO LOOK UP SOLUTION. See line 50
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="oldWay">
	Using Lorem Ipsum with 'pre' tag.
</h3>
	<p>(Found a way to stop using single quotes to reference tags. See line 66)</p>
	<p><strong>referencing # lines is not going to work, things change too often need a better solution</strong></p>
	<p>Found a solution or a workaround by using <a href="#newWay"> ID's as bookmarks</a></p>
	
<div>
	<pre id="lorem">
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
quis nostrud exercitation ullamco 
						
						laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo

	consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse

	</pre>
</div>
<p>
	May have found a work around with using the 'pre' tag. But it feels very haphazard to do that with normal text. My impression is the format and structure for what the 'pre' tag is supposed to do <em>IS</em> for showing code as regular text with all white space and special symbols rather using it as a way to format paragraphs of text in html
</p>
	<pre>
Found out there's a bunch of rules that you're not supposed to do like:

	<em>"You cannot nest block-level elements, such as 'pre' , inside 'p' in HTML, 
	so Tumblr is behaving correctly. You should close your paragraph before inserting 
	the pre-formatted text."</em> from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5371787/can-i-have-a-pre-tag-inside-a-p-tag-in-tumblr">Stack Overflow</a>

Found out "<a href="https://devpractical.com/display-html-tags-as-plain-text/"><em>How to display html tags as plain text in HTML</em></a>"
The author shows how you can use "Entity names" to show less than, more than, ect. But one of the coolest tips was using the find and replace feature. You can find all the < or > and replace them with "ctrl+h"

Example:

&lt;pre&gt; by typing out &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;

That was great but the author doesn't go into how to display &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; by themselves. Solution: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51006847/html-show-gt-in-plain-text"> Stack Overflow for the win!</a>


Also there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/1op-PqCGdIA">vid</a> that helps show "How to Display code as Code in a Browser".

The person mentions a few cool things like how to comment and un-comment something with the hotkey 'ctrl+/' in the code and to indent and outdent with the hotkeys: 'ctrl+[' or 'ctrl+]'.


	</pre>
<p>
	Found out about <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/semantic-html">"semantics" in HTML</a> it seems interesting and important.

	<h3 id="newWay">Using IDs as for bookmarks to jump from on part of the page to another</h3>
	I think I may have found a solution instead of referencing # lines of code! By using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp">IDs as bookmarks! Not sure if this is the best way but it's better than what I was doing</a>. Here was the <a href="#oldWay">'oldway'</a> by using &lt;pre&gt tags.

	I did two really important things in the last couple of days. I returned Mom's text. She had a prolific dream where I was there with her. After I replied to her, I called my Mom and we exchanged about our days. I told her I loved her. I felt compelled to and it felt good to. I then called my brother and had the longest conversation I've had with him in a while. There was a lot of that we talked about and it was very nice to catch up with him. All throughout the day, I felt a sense of good steady flow of calm energy even when class dragged on a bit and my attention wandered. The important part was I rewarded myself with a nice walk while it was warm and sunny and a slice of chocolate cake I baked the day before. I sat down and did office hours. I found out that Josh our IA has a pup named, "Ranger". Very cool! After office hours, I needed a break and sat down to watch something. I watched the last episode of "The Midnight Gospel". It was cathartic and felt good to finally finish the series. I still have to do homework. I'll try as long as I can. An extended version of "Dreams Wash Away" by Jon Wong is playing in the background while I write this and weigh on starting the homework. It's soothing and bitter sweet. Kinda the vibe I'm in.</p>
