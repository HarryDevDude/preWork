		<p>Q: A dogs page? And Cats?! <a href="https://c.tenor.com/wy2zHeWyf2gAAAAd/side-eye-dog-suspicious-look.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yes! but why?</a></p>

		<p>A: I was a dog walker before the pandemic. It was fun and at times a little hectic but very rewarding! I had to juggle a lot of client needs and be responsible for the safety and well-being of the pups and sometimes cats too! Cats?! Yes, I also provided dog/cat sitting services! This is a small album of some of those pups and cats!</p>

										Notes & Thoughts

	learned that you can indent or shift back whole blocks of code to the left by highlighting code and pressing 'ctrl [' for left and 'ctrl ]' for right indent. Source:

	https://superuser.com/questions/536768/how-to-shift-a-block-of-text-to-the-right-left-in-sublime-text-2

	Ran into a weird issues with YouTube links, it can cause permission issues with Firefox. I think it has to do with the YouTube "shorts" links and how it's coded.

	Found an interesting thing on CSS called, "The Box Model"

	Teo talked about using width with percentages to allow the code figure out the calculations.

	example 
	
	{
	width: 50% ;
	}

	Don't freak out when you get an error. It's okay because that's your program telling you something is no working properly. When there's no error and it doesn't work properly then that's problem. -Josh (paraphrased)
